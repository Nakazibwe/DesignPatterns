1)Figure out methods that are common to the primary component and optional layers. Then create an interface containing these methods.
2)Create a concrete component class to define the base behavior.
3)Create a base decorator class that has a reference to the wrapped object. The reference should be declared with the interface type to enable it to link between the concrete classes as well as the decorators.
4)Ensure all classes implement the base interface.
5)Create concrete decorators by extending them from the base decorator.
6)The client code must be responsible for creating decorators and composing them the way the client requires.
